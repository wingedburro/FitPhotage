## About The Project

![Fit Photage Logo][product-screenshot]

Fit Photage is an iOS application designed to connect a fitness coach with their students. The intention was to allow the coach to send customized workouts to individual students and exchange communication and documentation.

This app was a collaboration between Kevin Liao and I as part of our company: Winged Burro Studios

This application was never finished, as the client went a different direction with their business. Much of the application was still built and it was great experience for us as developers.
